# MedGemma: Conversational Medical AI
This is a powerful command-line tool designed for multimodal medical analysis. The application leverages Google's state-of-the-art MedGemma-4b-it model to provide expert-level analysis of both text-based medical queries and medical images.
The application operates in two distinct modes:
-	Conversational Q&A: Users can ask general medical questions and receive detailed explanations from the AI.
-	Interactive Image Analysis: Users can trigger an analysis of a local folder of medical images, selecting from a comprehensive list of 25 medical specialties to guide the AI's perspective.

This tool is built for stability, robustness, and a clean user experience, running entirely within a local terminal environment to ensure privacy and full control over system resources.
